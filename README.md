# Flappy Bird in Godot 3.x

Flappy Bird clone made using Godot 3.2.2

Live demo: https://theguyfromspace.itch.io/flappybird

Based on the Portuguese Godot 2.x Udemy Course by Daniel Ciolfi: https://www.udemy.com/course/godotengine/
Since there have been multiple changes in the later version of Godot, I decided to recreate this in the latest version, as of 20/9/20.
I do not own the assets. All assets were provided by the instructor of the course.
